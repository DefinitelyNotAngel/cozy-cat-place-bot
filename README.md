A random bot I made bcs I was bored lol.

At some point this was really barebones and useable for nothing (not like it is useable for anything now) but I am slowly testing out more and more stuff to make it more feature rich. The code is really, really unorganized, so don't expect to read any of it but when more features are tested out completely and they work I will organize their code a bit and use '#' more so I can describe what I'm trying to do more. The bot doesn't have an invite code because it definitely isn't stable for anything at all yet.
